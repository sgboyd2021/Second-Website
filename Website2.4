<h3>Explanation of Chart and Reasons Why the USA Should Help Developing Countries</h3>

<p id= "yes">This chart shows the difficulties that the average Senegalese student would face in comparison to the lives that the average Medfield student lead. This information is almost entirely first hand, from things that I saw and experienced in my short time there. I only saw a week's worth of Senegal, and most of it was quite honestly, the inside of our vans and out the windows. But what I could see is not contained in the chart above. Those are just some basic facts to show an American student the world outside of their safe town of Medfield. I personally saw kids walking for miles to get to their school, and then visited 2 of the schools there. I took one of the pictures above, and I did not take them only for memories. Some of the kids we saw did not know what they looked like, and they saw it as a game when I took their picture and then showed them what they looked like. The kids were endlessly adorable, and even though I only spoke a little French and they spoke French-Wolof, we found a way to communicate. They were all very sweet, and deserve the lives that Americans live. They do not deserve to have the struggles that they do, such as with sanitation, safety, health, and education. They cannot help where they were born, and should not live more difficult lives because of it. In addition, despite popular belief, the USA only spends 1% of their national budget on national aid, not the 20-25% that many Americans think we do. In conclusion, America should continue to help developing countries like Senegal. </p>

<h3 id= "no">Why the USA Should NOT Help Developing Countries</h3>
<ul id= "list">
    <li>"There's zero evidence that any of these foreign aid programs have had any effect on development, whether it's in the Middle East or Africa or South America" - Stephan Moore
    <li>The USA spends over $4 trillion in foreign aid
    <li>Afganistan alone receives $4.7 billion
    <li>Donald Trump proposed cuts in foreign aid funding in 2018, leading to a 25% cut in global health programs, and a 68% cut in the Bureau for Food Security
    <li>This is a total budget of $25.6 billion for both the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development
</ul>
<p id = "con">In conclusion, I believe that the USA should continue to help developing countries for the reasons stated above, including the fact that they do not have the same privileges and opportunities that we do in the USA. There are more than enough people who have done nothing to not deserve our help, and the government should look past our economy and at the families that live in the countries that they no longer want to help.</p>
